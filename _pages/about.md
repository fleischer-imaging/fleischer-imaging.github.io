We are a biomedical AI group specializing in improving the triage and treatment of COVID-19. Using machine learning, we discover patterns in patient data and use correlations to tailor treatment and predict patient outcome.

Unlike other companies and research groups that appear to do similar things, our proprietary algorithms make us unique in several important ways:
* We consider patient data holistically, including x-ray and ultrasound images, radiology reports, and blood tests;
* We look at the whole image as well as specific radiology zones, scanning as a human clinician would;
* We use multiple algorithms to leverage their individual strengths, e.g. one algorithm that focuses on similarities in the data and another that emphasizes differences;
* We not only distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases (with an accuracy >99%) but identify different phenotypes within COVID; and
* Our methods give quantitative results on the type and severity of COVID-19 

# Goals

Our immediate goals are to:

* **Improve patient triage** so that medical resources can be allocated more efficiently (e.g. ventilators and ICU beds);
* **Find the best treatments** specific to COVID-19 type; and
* **Predict the long-term effects** of COVID-19

# How you can help

**Provide data!**

We have an established information pipeline that will help you de-identify data, to protect patient privacy, and upload it to our site for processing.

We work with medical facilities of all sizes, from individual physicians and domestic clinics to international hospital systems, and will benefit from any information you can provide.
